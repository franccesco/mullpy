# Mullpy
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/franccesco/mullpy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/franccesco/mullpy) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/franccesco/mullpy/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://coveralls.io/github/franccesco/mullpy?branch=develop)

## This tool is now deprecated, please use the official [Mullvad CLI](https://mullvad.net/en/help/how-use-mullvad-cli/)

A little tool to check if you're currently connected to **Mullvad** VPN or not and also checks for an open port and a DNS leak test. If you want to read more about Mullvad VPN you can goa head and read the _very flattering_ [Mullvad review here](https://thatoneprivacysite.net/2017/10/03/mullvad-review/) by [That One Privacy Site](https://thatoneprivacysite.net/)

The tool _does not_ intend to be a swiss army knife, just a two day mini-project so I don't have to go to [am.i.mullvad.net](http://am.i.mullvad.net/) everytime to check on my connection. **For WebRTC you should go to their website!**
